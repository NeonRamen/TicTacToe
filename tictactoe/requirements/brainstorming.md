## About the game
TicTacToe is a game, that consists of a two dimensional playing field with the dimensions 3x3.
Two player play against each other, one after the other. Each player gets a symbol (either 
an x or an o) and puts it in one of the nine fields. The other player can't place his symbol
on a field that is already occupied, making the game consist of a maximum of 9 moves for both
players together. The goal is to get your own three identical symbols next to each other, either horizontally,
vertically or diagonal, with the rule, that they have to be in a straight line.
